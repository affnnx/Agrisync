# Project Name

## Description

This project is a decentralized application (DApp) that combines a React frontend, a Node.js backend, and smart contracts written in Solidity. It aims to provide a decentralized solution for [describe the purpose or problem your project solves].

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
- client/          (React frontend)
  - src/
    - components/  (React components)
    - styles/      (CSS stylesheets)
  - package.json   (frontend dependencies and scripts)

- src/             (Node.js backend)
  - controllers/   (backend logic)
  - routes/        (API routes)
  - package.json   (backend dependencies and scripts)

```

## Installation

To install and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12.0 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Truffle (Solidity development environment)

### Clone the repository

```
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `client` folder:
   ```
   cd client
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `src` folder:
   ```
   cd ../src
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Smart Contracts Setup

1. Navigate to the `contracts` folder:
   ```
   cd ../contracts
   ```

2. Compile the Solidity smart contracts:
   ```
   truffle compile
   ```
3. Migrate Solidity smart contracts:
   ```
   truffle migrate
   ```

### Run the Application

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd ../src
   npm start
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, start the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd ../client
   npm start
   ```

3. Access the application by opening your web browser and visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
